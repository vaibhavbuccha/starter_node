## Advantages of using nodejs
--------------
- it makes building real-time apps (eg. chat or gaming) lightning fast,
- It makes coding in JavaScript for both the client and server side possible,
- it increases the efficiency of the development process as it fills the gap between frontend and backend developers
- the ever-growing NPM (Node Package Manager) gives developers multiple tools and modules to use, thus further boosting their productivity
- code executes faster than in any other language,
- Node is perfect for microservices which are a popular solution among enterprise apps.

- Easy Scalability
> Node.JS is a lightweight technology and one of the key benefits of Node.JS is that it is considered to be the best option for micro-service architecture. Developers find it quite easy to scale the applications in horizontal as well as vertical directions. It becomes easier to add more micro-services on the top of the existing one.

- JS is Easy to Learn
> Since JavaScript is one of the most widely accepted and popular programming languages among developers, most of the front-end developers have a good hold on it. For them, to use Node.JS as backend becomes a lot easier.

- Used as Single Programming Language
>Node.JS offers the developers facility of writing server-side application in the JavaScript. This allows the developers to write front-end and back-end web application in JavaScript using a runtime environment.

> As all the web browsers support JavaScript, so the deployment of web applications also becomes much easier.

- Benefit of Full Stack JS
> It is known as full stack JavaScript as it serves both client and server side applications. It adds up as one more benefit of Node.JS as you donâ€™t need to hire separate developers for back-end and front-end development. It helps to save your money, time and effort.

- Offers High Performance
> As mentioned earlier, Node.JS runs the JavaScript code via Google V8 JavaScript engine and it compiles the JavaScript code directly into the machine code. This process facilitates easier and faster implementation of codes in an effective manner.

- Large and Active Community
> Node.JS Developers community is very dynamic and constantly contributes to the improvement and betterment of Node.JS and it is expected that we will witness more positive and absolute solution rich eco-system.

- JS Offers freedom to Develop Apps
> Another significant advantage of Node.JS is that it offers freedom to develop apps and software, unlike other imposing certain guidelines to developing apps and software.

- Facility of Caching Single Modules
> The open source run time environment of Node.JS single modules caching feature. The request from the first module gets cached in the application memory, allowing applications to load the web page faster and responds very smoothly to the end users.

-  Extended support for Various Commonly Used Tools
> Node.JS developers get extended support for various tools. For example- You can test the source code of Node.JS by using Jasmin and other such tools. Similarly, you can identify and install the project dependencies using npm, a powerful package manager.

-  Process Several Request Concurrently
> Node.JS helps you to process several requests simultaneously. It can handle simultaneous request handling better than others, including Ruby on Rails and Python.
